# Awesome DeepSeek Harness Plugins [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

English | [简体中文](README.zh.md)

> A curated index of plugins, starters, tools, and primary resources for [DeepSeek Harness (DSH)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).

[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) is DeepSeek AI's open-source, plugin-first agent harness: models, tools, skills, sessions, sandboxes, filesystems, loops, orchestration, and UI can all be composed as plugins.

> **Developer preview** — DSH is changing quickly and may introduce breaking changes. This independent community list is not endorsed by DeepSeek AI or walkinglabs. Review source code and pin a DSH version/commit before installing any third-party plugin. [中文说明](README.zh.md)

## Quick Tutorial — Install DSH and Write Your First Plugin

### 1. Install and run DeepSeek Harness

Install a current [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) release, then run:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3080`. In **Settings → Models**, add a DeepSeek API key; then select a workspace before starting a session. The official [Web UI guide](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/master/docs/user/guide/index.md) explains the next steps.

### 2. Create a minimal plugin from source

Plugin development currently starts from an official DSH checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness.git
cd deepseek-harness
pnpm install
pnpm run build
mkdir -p scratch-plugin/src
```

Create `scratch-plugin/src/hello-plugin.ts`:

```ts
import type { Context } from '@deepseek-ai/cordis'

export const name = 'hello-plugin'

export function apply(ctx: Context) {
  console.log('[hello-plugin] loaded')
}
```

Then create `scratch-plugin/cordis.yml`. Replace the path with the absolute path printed by `pwd` in the DSH checkout:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: hello
      name: '/absolute/path/to/deepseek-harness/scratch-plugin/src/hello-plugin.ts'
```

Run the development overlay:

```sh
pnpm dsh web --patch ./scratch-plugin/cordis.yml
```

When DSH starts, the terminal should show `[hello-plugin] loaded`. This is the smallest valid DSH plugin: export `apply(ctx)` and register capabilities through the Cordis context. To add an agent-callable tool, declare `export const inject = ['tools']` and register it with the documented DSH tool API. Follow the official [first plugin](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/master/docs/user/develop/basic/index.md) and [tool-plugin](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/master/docs/user/develop/basic/tool.md) tutorials for the complete, current API.

### 3. How the plugin mechanism works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Overlay["cordis.yml overlay"] -->|loads| Module["Plugin module"]
  Module --> Contract["name · inject · apply(ctx, config)"]
  Contract --> Inject["inject: wait for required services"]
  Contract --> Config["Config schema: validate settings and defaults"]
  Contract --> Apply["apply: register capabilities"]
  Apply --> Capabilities["Tools · commands · events · UI · services"]
  Capabilities --> Runtime["Cordis / DSH runtime"]
  Runtime --> Effects["Lifecycle-managed effects"]
  Effects --> Cleanup["Unload or HMR: registrations are cleaned up"]
```

DSH is built on **Cordis**, a runtime composition framework. A plugin is not merely an npm dependency: it is a module that DSH loads into a live context. The plugin declares a `name`, optionally declares `inject` dependencies such as `['tools']`, and exports `apply(ctx, config)`. Cordis waits until injected services are ready, validates any exported `Config` schema and defaults, then invokes `apply`.

Inside `apply`, the plugin can register a tool for the agent, a human command, a settings schema, event listeners, Web UI components, or a service for other plugins. Registrations are lifecycle-managed effects: on unload or hot replacement after a config edit, Cordis removes old registrations automatically. Use `ctx.effect()` only when your plugin owns a resource needing explicit cleanup, such as a timer or network connection. See the official [configuration guide](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/master/docs/user/develop/basic/config.md), [service guide](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/master/docs/user/develop/framework/service.md), and [capability seams](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/master/docs/capability-seams.md).

### 4. What this awesome list includes

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Discover["GitHub discovery\n(recent public candidates)"] --> Verify["Source-level DSH verification"]
  Verify -->|"Manifest/package + documented DSH seam"| Plugin["Verified DSH plugin"]
  Verify -->|"Explicit, inspectable DSH integration"| Resource["Client, launcher, example, or dev resource"]
  Verify -->|"Topic/name/claim only"| Exclude["Excluded\n(not a DSH plugin)"]
  Plugin --> List["Plugin categories in this list"]
  Resource --> List
  List --> Daily["Daily review\nOnly real changes are committed"]
```

The list distinguishes verified DSH plugins from useful but non-plugin resources such as launchers, clients, and ecosystem directories. See the full [inclusion policy](docs/INCLUSION_POLICY.md) for the evidence required before a new entry is added.

### 5. One runtime, different compositions

DSH profiles are plugin compositions rather than separately maintained products. The official base bundle includes model adapters, tools, persistence, sandbox and approval policy, settings, credentials, and telemetry; Web and headless bundles add different entry surfaces. An agent preset can then give a session a different capability set.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Base["dsh-base\nmodels · tools · persistence · sandbox\napproval · settings · telemetry"]
  Base --> WebProfile["Web profile\nbrowser application"]
  Base --> HeadlessProfile["Headless profile\none-shot runner"]
  Base --> Preset["Agent preset\nper-session capability composition"]
  Preset --> Loop["Agent loop"]
  Preset --> Toolset["Toolset"]
  Preset --> Providers["LLM / filesystem / subagent providers"]
  Preset --> Policy["Permission & sandbox policy"]
```

This makes a “mode” primarily a selected plugin graph and policy set. It does not guarantee that every composition is stable or suitable for every task; DSH is still a developer preview.

### 6. Tool calls use one guarded execution pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Call["Model emits tool call"] --> LoggedCall["Log tool/call"]
  LoggedCall --> Pre["tools/pre-execute\nhooks · permission · sandbox"]
  Pre --> Ask{"Approval needed?"}
  Ask -->|approved| Guards["Monotonic guards"]
  Ask -->|denied / unavailable| Denied["Skip tool body"]
  Guards --> Execute["tools/execute\ntimeout · retry · metrics"]
  Execute --> Body["Tool execute()"]
  Body --> Post["tools/post-execute\naccept · block · replace"]
  Denied --> Post
  Post --> Result["Finalize & log tool/result"]
  Result --> UI["UI result card"]
  Result --> Next["Next model request"]
```

Plugins can insert policy, observability, timeout, or result-handling behavior at documented stages without editing the Agent Loop. The official pipeline also routes Code Mode's dispatched sub-calls through this same path, preserving the approval, sandbox, and logging boundaries.

### 7. Agent turns, steps, and the append-only session log

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant A as Agent loop
  participant P as Prompt assembler
  participant M as Model
  participant T as Tool pipeline
  participant L as Append-only session log
  U->>A: followup(message)
  A->>L: turn/start + user/message
  A->>P: assemble prompt sections + tool schemas
  P->>M: request
  M-->>L: assistant/chunk*
  M-->>L: assistant/message
  M->>T: tool/call*
  T-->>L: tool/result*
  A->>L: step/end
  alt more input or tool results are owed
    A->>P: next step
  else no pending work
    A->>L: turn/end
  end
```

The session log is the model-context source of truth: durable events record turns, messages, tool calls/results, and raw stream chunks. Forking, resuming, replay, transcripts, telemetry, and persistence derive from that stream; model-visible content must be reconstructable from it.

### 8. Multi-agent and workflow extension points

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Parent["Parent agent\nplans, delegates, aggregates"] --> Subagent["Subagent capability seam"]
  Subagent --> Fresh["Fresh child agent"]
  Subagent --> Fork["Forked / continued session"]
  Subagent --> External["External product provider\n(e.g. ACP-backed)"]
  Parent --> Workflow["Workflow capability"]
  Workflow --> Parallel["Parallel branches"]
  Workflow --> Pipeline["Pipeline stages"]
  Workflow --> Background["Background work"]
  Fresh --> Events["subagent/* + session/event"]
  Fork --> Events
  External --> Events
  Workflow --> Events
  Events["Durable session events + live agent events"] --> Inspect["UI, trajectory, replay, telemetry"]
```

DSH provides a hierarchy-oriented delegation surface and workflow components; providers behind the subagent seam can vary. The key architectural point is replaceability and shared observability, not a claim that DSH has invented a new multi-agent paradigm.

### Curation policy

The `dsh-plugin` topic, a `dsh-` repository name, or a README claim alone is **not enough** for an entry in this list. Every new plugin must meet the source-level verification policy in [INCLUSION_POLICY.md](docs/INCLUSION_POLICY.md): a real DSH plugin manifest/package or a verifiable, official DSH extension seam. Discovery runs daily over projects from the previous 48 hours; candidates also undergo static security triage of scripts, dependencies, entrypoints, workflows, and sensitive operations. Only candidates that pass both checks are added. This is not a complete security audit or a compatibility guarantee.
